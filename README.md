# Background
For this course, I am analyzing a WhatsApp group export from my apartment building.<br>
The project focuses on three main categories of discussion:
- Facilities
- Hygiene
- Security

Each category is linked to a specific keyword, which serves as a parameter for the analysis script.<br>
For example, in the Facilities category the keyword can be “lift.”

# Script usage
## Install uv package manager
Make sure you have `uv` installed. You can check this by typing `which uv` in the terminal. If that doesnt return a location but `uv not found` you need to install it.<br>
On Unix systems, you can use `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`, for Windows read the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)


## Activate venv
Activate venv<br>
From the root directory of the project activate and verify the `venv`:<br>

```
(base) jdoe-MacBook-Pro:MADS-DAV jdoe$ source .venv/bin/activate
(wa-analyzer) (base) jdoe-MacBook-Pro:MADS-DAV jdoe$
```
## Run script
After this, you can run the scripts with the following `command` and `keyword`, eg:

### week 2
keyword options: ["lift", "schoon", "camera"]<br>

```

### week 3

uv run apartment_community_wk3
```

### week 4
```
uv run apartment_community_wk4 --top 5
```

### week 5
```
uv run  apartment_community_wk5 --keyword lift
```

### week 6
```
uv run  apartment_community_wk6 --label Gender --keywords lift camera trap ventilatie
```

## Logs

For logfile folder location see section 'Project structure'. <br>
The logging is also printed on the terminal output.
